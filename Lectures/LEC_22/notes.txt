No routing or security on this test

HW Question:
route -n is what the routing table should look like

TCP wrapper / Kernel level firewall (ufw) might block #4

6 Steps for Security:
        -Filter (firewall)
        -Stop (services, systemctl)
        -Patch (apt-get)
        -Backup
        -Passwords
        -Monitor

Services:
        AVHI - Advertises RPi on the network and tells what services
                are available (bad)
        sudo systemctl stop ntp.service (
                       start
                       disable
                       mask     (Absolutely not stop ever)

Stop vs. Disable
        Start during doot vs. runtime
Stop is for runtime, Disable is for boot

Dig in, find what packaged are
dpkg

Processes in brackets are kernel threahds, can't get rid of them 

Backup is complicated

Simple:
        copy files
Complex:
        AMANDA

Users - /etc/passwd
        username:x:UID:GID:Group:HomeDir:Shell

        USERADD
        USERDEL
        USERMOD

passwd file has locking
        passwd
