Security
---------

How do we get into (break into) other systems?
        -Get physical access
        -Open doors (default passwords, bad passwords)
        -Buggy software (poor error checking, buffer overflows)
                Buffer overflow: go further in the stack, change return address to your code, but your code further down)
        -Intentional backdoors
        
Be secure:
Six step process:
        1 - Filter
                Run a firewall
                        OSI level 3
                        Hardware firewall
                        Kernel level firewall (UFW, IP tables)
                        User level (TCP wrappers, services)
        2 - Stop
                Don't run services that are unnecessary
                        TFTP    (unencrypted)
                        Telnet  (unencrypted)
                        RSH
                        Finger  Gets all info but passwords 
        3 - Patch
                Keep up to date, do updates
                Apply patches to test machine and test it before production machine
                apt-update/apt-upgrade
        4 - Backup
                Linux rootkit (LRK) (You'll show up on FBI watchlist)
                        Hacked up everyday code bits (ls, pwd, etc)
                        Adds new executables etc that hide
                If you are broken into, you cannot guarantee the integrity of the system
                        Return to a point prior to being broken into
                Problem with backups:
                        Make sure they are secure
                        Run automatically, don't do anything, when you go to look at it later
                                you find it never was working
                Exercise them once in a while
                AMANDA
                        Super awesome, indexes everything, 
                LKRK - Linux Kernel Rootkit - insert modules
        5 - Passwords
                Random character passwords are bad policy
                Forced password changes are bad policy
                Minimum length goodis good policy
                Using a sequence of common words is fine
        6 - Monitor
                Check your system
                /var/log
                Automatic AND Manual checking
