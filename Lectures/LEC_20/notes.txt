[A]ddress [R]esolution [P]rotocol (ARP)
connecting computer sends out a 
        whohas IP
to everybody (broadcast)

conectee responds 
        I am IP

Works for small networks, but how do we get MACs for devices
eslewhere on the internet:

Routing (Layer 3) (At the IP level)

Computer connect into switch, into router

Every computer had a routing table
(command: route)
if IP matches an entry, follow that rule
if IP range entries match, follow the default rule
        (usually heads to gateway)

Wanna talk to MIT

ENET:            IP:
| DA | SA | Type | SA | DA |
Give MAC of router and IP of website to router
Router routes using its routing table

check path: traceroute www.mit.edu

Security
-----
The most secure operating system is "Windows, OSX, Linux"
The least secure operating system is " " " " " " " " " " "

The most secure machine is
        No network
        In a safe
        Buried
        Off 

-Security is inversely proportional to convenience
-Physical access 

Why?
-To protect sensitive data
-Liability
-Protect infrastructure

Security is not a technology problem, it's a human behavior problem

Secure your system. Security of a system is about how you manage it
