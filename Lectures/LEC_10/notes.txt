Homework:
        Use $1, $2, $3 to access captured parts of REs (captured by ())
        Change extension of filename in perl:
                $fn

                $fn =~s/[^.]*$/.gpx/;
                
        /^ +-Wseletor        

Exam: Open pi, open notes, no computer. Next thursday in class.
        Chance extension of file in perl

grep -E (egrep) # grep w/ ERE
wc       # word count
tail -n  # Gives last n lines of file 
head -n  # Gives first n lines of file
awk      # Column processort
        awk '{Print $1}' # Split on whitespace by default, print first column
sed -e   # Substitutes RE with SUB
        sed -e 'S/RE/SUB/
tar      # Tape archive - puts many files into one (archive) NOT compression
        gzip, bz2 # Compression algorithms
        tar -clzf hw.tar.gz ECE331/HW # Compresses ECE331/HW into hw.tar.gz
                                      # Preserve permission
        tar -xpf hw.tar.gz
file     # Gives filetype (based on magic number)
         # Magic number of Perl script is #! (first few bytes in the file)
                # Impress your friends!
sort     # Sorts lexically (sorts by ASCII)
         # 1
         # 10
         # 2
         # etc
         sort -m to sort by numbers
         sort -r to reverse
diff     # Compare files '-' = removed, '+' = added
         diff x y # <- points to x, >+ points to y. 
find dir -name 'glob'
         # Finds name matching glob in directory
         # All kinds of options, age, size, etc

grep '^0' runtimedata.txt | awk '(print $2)' | sed -re 's/^.{6}//' | perl -ne 'chomp; s/$/+/; print; | sed -e 's/$/0\n/' | bs
         # Prints seconds column of runtimedata.txt and puts pluses between them, performs the addition

perl -n  # -m causes perl to assume a loop around command

module7.symvms # Snag this from GitHub raspberrpi/firmware/extra
               # Need to get correct kernel version one
               # Find where it fits in between the kernel versions without being too 'new'
               # DON'T copy and paste from the web page
               # Maybe ~4432 
git checkout __commit ID__ for your kernel version
               # HAVE to make sure you have the correct kernel version
               # Source much match running version of linux
usr/src/linux  # Check the makefile and make sure the versions match
git log        # Get commit ID

while(2) {     # Try this on your FRIEND'S computer
        fork();

        A couple of flavors: monolithic, modular, micro
                Monolithic: everything you want is compiled into the kernel, can't change it until you 
                        recompile the kernel
                Modular: Can modify kernels behavior/capability at runtime. Tradeoff is speed. Modular
                        has more overhead
